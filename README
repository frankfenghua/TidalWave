Git Repository for TidalWave.

I'm not sure if everything will go in here, but will start with a few things that can be open sourced.

First, a Wufoo type Form builder. I couldn't find one that was worth anything online in Sencha or JQuery so I created one in Sencha. 
Second, a data model for the latest thing that I'm building.
Last, just some notes for friend that I'm helping out. 

We'll see how this going.
